# Character Generator Feature Implementation

## Summary of Changes Made

I've successfully implemented the three requested features for the Fantasy Character Generator:

### 1. **Ambient Soundscapes** ✅
- Added location-based ambient sound generation using ElevenLabs sound generation API
- The character's `location` field (e.g., "tavern", "forest", "castle") is used to generate appropriate ambient sounds
- Added play/stop functionality with visual feedback
- Ambient sounds loop automatically and play at 30% volume for background atmosphere
- Sound generation creates 10-second ambient clips
- Ambient audio is cleared when switching characters or creating new ones

### 2. **Custom Quotes** ✅
- Added an edit button next to the character quote
- Users can click the edit button to modify the character's quote
- The quote is saved and can be used to regenerate the voice with the new text
- After saving, users are prompted if they want to regenerate the voice immediately
- Custom quotes are preserved when saving characters to the collection

### 3. **PDF Text Overlap Fix** ✅
- Fixed the PDF generation to prevent text from overlapping with the character image
- Added proper spacing calculations to account for image placement
- The basic information section now adjusts its column width when an image is present
- Stats box and subsequent sections are positioned below the image to avoid overlap
- Description section now uses full width since it appears below the image area

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
- **script.js**: Added all new functionality
- **index.html**: Already had UI elements in place
- **style.css**: Already had styling for new elements

### Key Methods Added:
- `toggleAmbientSound()`: Handles ambient sound generation and playback
- `updateAmbientButton()`: Updates the ambient button UI state
- `startEditingQuote()`: Shows the quote editing interface
- `saveCustomQuote()`: Saves the custom quote and updates the character
- `cancelEditingQuote()`: Cancels quote editing

### State Management:
- Added `isPlayingAmbient` and `currentAmbientBlob` properties
- Added proper cleanup of ambient audio when switching characters
- Added `location` field validation with default value "tavern"

## How to Test the Features

1. **Ambient Sounds**:
   - Generate a character
   - Click the "Ambient Sound" button (green button in the export section)
   - The button will change to "Stop Ambient" when playing
   - Ambient sounds will loop continuously at 30% volume

2. **Custom Quotes**:
   - Generate a character
   - Click the edit icon next to the character's quote
   - Enter a new quote (max 50 characters)
   - Click Save
   - You'll be prompted to regenerate the voice with the new quote

3. **PDF Export**:
   - Generate a character
   - Click "Export Character as PDF"
   - The PDF should now have proper spacing with no text/image overlap

## Notes
- All features integrate seamlessly with the existing character management system
- Ambient sounds and custom quotes work with the character collection feature
- The implementation maintains the existing code style and patterns
- Error handling is included for all new features
